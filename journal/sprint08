Monday 3-25 to Monday 4-1

3-31:
     * game object recycler implemented and working
     * full cloud integration of projects between all members
     * updated scripts for scene changes and player movement
        - game can change based on parameters such as the amount of enemies killed etc. 
     * xbox controller implementation was worked on, but not fully working
        - idea is to map certains keys on the keyboard to buttons on the controller, however
          we need to create functionalities for keys on the keyboard
        - pause menu mapped to the p button
