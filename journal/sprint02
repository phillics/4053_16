Sunday 2-10 to Sunday 2-17

2-13:
      Created sprite sheets and started working on combining different png images to create animations for how Brother Monk
      will walk. Searched for enemy sprites and projectile sprites.
      
2-17:
      * Worked on mechanics of gameplay. 
      
         - Figured out a way to create spawn points for enemies as well as how to shoot
           projectiles from a character sprite.
           (Need to implement Brother monk sprite, default circle sprite being used currently.)
        
         - Figured out hit detection, player loses health when enemy collides with player.
      
         - Simple AI implemented as well, enemies chase player around screen.
      
         - Player is also able to shoot at enemies, making them disappear from the screen, 
           both the enemy and projectile are removed from the screen.
