Monday 2-18 to Sunday 2-24

2-21:
     Implemented sprites with walking scripts. Ran into problems with getting the player to work with the shooting scripts 
     while adding the animations. Got enemy fighting animations working along with their walking animations however both the 
     character and the enemy walking animations are not perfected (seem to be gliding along the map however they know which 
     way to turn based on script). Found better sprites for orbs and edited elemental orbs.

2-23:
     Working on start screen and trying to get the projectiles to shoot past the mouse.
