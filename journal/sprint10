Monday 4-8 to Sunday 4-14

4-14:
     * focusing on game optimization and working out bugs that were highligheted during our game testing day
       - the bugs that needed to be fixed
          1. player losing health when shooting on the left side of the screen
             need to look into where the collision is happening on the screen even though the player is not being hit. Could be 
             due to the fact that the projectile is going through the health bar.
          2: music does not loop throughout the game
          3: enemy and player colliders do not look natural. coming from the top of the screen the 2.5D motion of the game makes the 
             hitboxes bigger than they actually are.
       - these were some of the main bugs that we were focusing on.
          
     * Create CameraController for integration with larger maps
       - attaches camera to player and allows player to move around larger maps.
       - only translation, movement is independent of rotation
