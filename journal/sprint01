2-3:
    Created GitHub repository
    
2-5:
    Finished presentation and discussed ideas on how the player will interact with the game and what they will see as well as editted 
    our goals for the first playable.
    
    These ideas include the: 
        reload system for the orbs
        how the map should be rendered
        the I/O devices used in the game
        the type of configurations for the orbs
    
    Our new goals for a first playable:
        Map is rendered on screen
        Avatar responds to player input (moves and shoots)
        Enemies can attack player (collision)
        Shield mechanic neutralizes enemy hitbox collision within certain distance from shield

    
    Reload System - Player should not run out of ammo while shooting unless their intent is to do high damages. In which case, ammo will
                    be depleted and restored on a fixed cooldown. (0.5 seconds)
    
    Map Rendering - Maps will be made static instead of randomly generated.
    
    I/O Devices - Player will use a keyboard and mouse to play our game. WASD keys will be used to navigate through the map while
                  the mouse will be used to determine the direction the player is facing.
                    
    Variety of Orb Configurations - All orbs will possess some elemental powers such as fire, ice, and electricity. However, while 
                                    on defense, the player will be able to make a shield that can protect them from attacks. This shield 
                                    will be able to rotate 360 degree around the player.
