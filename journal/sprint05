Monday 3-4 to Sunday 3-10

*one month til final project due*

3-8: 
    Outline for tasks that need to be accomplished or repolished
    
    - approach our shooting with a new perspective
        * recycling game object that are being made when shooting happens
    - implement health bar
    - polish boss AI that will actively try to shoot and deplete your health bar as well as avoid 70% of the 
      shots that you shoot at it 
        * maybe implement new type of shooting (homing projectiles, shotgun spread, etc.)
    - limit ammo capacity, currently player can shoot endlessly
        * this is making the game lag due to the amount of gameobjects being created without recycling and reusing them
