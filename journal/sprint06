Monday 3-11 to Sunday 3-17

3-17:
     Outline of tasks I have attempted over spring break
     * polishing projectiles, meaning recycling game objects instead of creating new ones everytime a projectile is called.
       this can elimniate the lag on our game when animations are implemented. (creating those objects and setting booleans to them whether
       or not they have been unlocked)
     * health bar, may change to health points (3 hearts rather a full bar)
